- *Working members*: Antonio Pio Maggio, Gabriele Santangelo
- *Repo*: [ground-station-ui](https://github.com/PolibaX/ground-station-ui)

Ground Station UI for displaying telemetry data from the system, camera feed, ambient mapping, and node status.
This also allows mission control and status display.

### ROS2-GCS Bridge
- *Progress*: 80%
- *Status*: New protocols in developement üöß
- *Working members*: Gabriele Santangelo, Antonio Pio Maggio
- *Repo*: [ros2-gcs-bridge](https://github.com/PolibaX/ros2-gcs-bridge)

Bridge from ROS2 to Ground Control Station and back via WebSocket protocol.

### ZED WebRTC
- *Progress*: 80%
- *Status*: Working not complete üëç
- *Working members*: Antonio Pio Maggio
- *Repo*: [ZED-WebRTC](https://github.com/PolibaX/ZED-WebRTC)

Tool to stream ZED's video feed (or any other video feed) over the network using the WebRTC protocol.
